## Digital Badge planning

### Potential lessons for digital badges

1. Provide a screenshot of the supplemental data file list for a research article from the journal [Genome Biology](https://genome.cshlp.org/).

2. For your chosen paper, please give a directory contents list for the data files (images and tables) that constitute the Supplemental Files.

3. Using ((assigned genomic paper)), please find/identify the following: 

* genomic data that are publicly-available.

* an exemplar dataset using the Gene Expression Omnibus accession number.

* provide a screenshot for this dataset (include the accession number and characteristics).


4. post a sample dataset to Figshare. Publish and submit the doi generated for this submission.


5. Find a dataset on [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/) and provide the following information: 1) digital identifier (doi), 2) title of the associated paper, 3) the creative commons license type, 4) a list of the different files in the package and their size.


6. discuss how you might go about reviewing a dataset. Focus on the following aspects: 1) quality control (check for errors, potential forgery), 2) consistency, 3) sufficient annotation.


### Integration of Mozilla data reuse template and badge lessons

1) Header information: Title of Dataset (describe), assign permenant ID (doi), classify according to a subject index.

2) Credits: Authors ([authorship tree](https://figshare.com/articles/The_Authorship_Tree/4731913)), corresponding author. 

3) Inputs: data source (survey, instrument), related citations, provenance (physical location, temporal coverage).

4) Process: describe data collection, cleaning and normalization methods.

5) Outputs: open format for distribution (csv, XML), metadata, data dictionary (codebook, decribe variables and units).
