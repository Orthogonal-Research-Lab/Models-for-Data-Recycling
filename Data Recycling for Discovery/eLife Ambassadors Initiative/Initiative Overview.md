## What is the main problem your initiative addresses?  
This initiative addresses the need for a set of community standards and a set of formal practices for data reuse. Data reuse has two components: the creation of secondary and/or tertiary datasets, or the creation of new insights that can only be made with non-primary data collection.  

We also want to serve as a community resource for newcomers and current practitioners of open data recycling. Therefore, we view data recycling as enabling both derivative data analysis  and meta research, as well as providing a mechanism for research reproducibility. 

## How will your initiative function?  
Newcomers to this initiative will gain exposure to the practice of data recycling and/or work towards building a reproducible infrastructure for data recycling. We will work as a distributed group, and focus our efforts on the following goals:  

* development of a data reuse architecture [1]  and knowledge base of pre-existing tools.  

* aggregation and dissemination of information on data recycling, supported by the maintenance and development of course materials.

* a framework for establishing and periodically updating community standards for data reporting.  

* a set of data structures/best practices that can ease the implementation of data sharing and reuse.  

## What are the expected outcomes of your initiative?  
Our goals are as follows:  

* edit and update the existing course module [2] by introducing a greater degree of content and interactivity, and suitability for multiple audiences. Eventually, we would like to host a series of  webinars on topics in data recycling. 
 
* develop data structures for sharing and recycling within and between disciplines along with best practices for data sharing and recycling. These proposed standards will be an outcome of an online survey of community members, and will include an in-depth report on the survey results.

* create new educational assets such as digital badges (microcredentials) and blogposts to foster educational opportunities on the topic.  

* create a topical review [3] and curated reference list (annotated bibliography) [4] for existing research in the areas of open data, data recycling, and reproducibility.

## Who will be involved?  
Drs. Bradly Alicea and Marije Verhage have agreed to be the co-leads. The following Ambassadors have expressed interest in the initiative: @m.l.verhage, @huajinw, and @bhavik.nathwani. Specifically, there has been interest in creating a set of data reuse standards in the form of data structures and other techniques for use within and across academic fields.
 
Part of the existing data reuse course module is part of the “Reproducibility for Everybody” initiative. Ambassadors need no previous experience in the topic, and all are welcome. A short onboarding session will be held for potential collaborators.
 
We also have a number of existing tutorials on How to Create Microcredentials and Version Control for Distributed Science to help people contribute to the project. The initiative website has more details.  
 
## What is the timeline?
We are currently on an open timeline, although we do have several target dates for specific outcomes. Collaborators can suggest contributions through a Github pull request in this repository, or submit their contributions to project lead Alicea.
 
Current Milestones:
Blogpost draft will be submitted by August 2019 to be edited and finalized by September 2019. 

Information for course module update will be collected through September 2019. New sources will be discussed internally amongst the members of the initiatives through Dec 2019. Course module presentation will be updated through March 2019. Webinar will be scheduled for soon-after. 

Survey of community will be developed through Sep 2019. Survey will be live Oct 2019 through Dec 2019. Data will be analyzed, report collated through April 2020. Publication of the results follow thereafter.
