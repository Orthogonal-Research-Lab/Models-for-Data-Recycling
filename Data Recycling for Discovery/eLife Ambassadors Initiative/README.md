## What is the main problem your initiative addresses?
This initiative addresses the need for a set of community standards and a set of formal practices for data reuse. Data reuse has two components: the creation of secondary and/or teritiary datasets, or the creation of new insights that can only be made with non-primary data collection.

## How will your initiative function?
Newcomers to this initiative will 1) gain exposure to the practice of data recycling, and/or 2) work towards building a reproducible infrastructure for data recycling. We will work as a distributed collaborative group, and focus our efforts on a data reuse architecture [1] and course materials.

## What are the expected outcomes of your initiative?
Our goals are as follows:

Refactor the existing course module [2] by introducing a greater degree of content and interactivity. We also need people to work through the existing and proposed assignments to gauge their plausibility.

Create new educational assets such as digital badges or working prototypes of the data reuse architecture.

Create a “field-finding” review [3] and curated reference list (annotated bibliography) [4] for the topical areas of open data, data recycling, and reproducibility.

## Please list/tag other Ambassadors who’ve agreed to join your team and support the initiative
Part of the existing data reuse course module is part of the “Reproducibility for Everybody” initiative. Ambassadors need no previous experience in the topic, and all are welcome. A short onboarding session will be held for potential collaborators.

We are currently on an open timeline, although this may change as we approach Fall 2019. Collaborators can suggest contributions through a Github pull request, or submit their contributions to an initiative leader.
