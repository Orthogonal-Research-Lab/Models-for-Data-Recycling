# Models for Data Recycling

This repository contains a copy of a mini-grant (Mozilla-mini-grant-proposal.md) submitted to the Mozilla Foundation on 11-30-2018, as well as a diagram of the reuse architecture (data-reuse-architecture.png) proposed in the document.  

ThinkSpace for Reproducibility Pipeline:  

* merge with reproducibility factors.  

* how do we encourage reproducibility in data reuse (consistent outcomes/results, not just procedures).
