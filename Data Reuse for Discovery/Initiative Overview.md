## What is the main problem your initiative addresses?
Combining existing datasets from different authors is currently a challenging enterprise, because each author has their own way of building and storing their datasets, often without clear codebooks or notes. This makes the combining effort much more time-consuming for both primary and secondary research. This initiative addresses the need for a set of community standards for building up datasets and a set of formal practices for data reuse (e.g., annotating and storing data). Data reuse has two components: the creation of secondary and/or tertiary datasets, or the creation of new insights that can only be made with non-primary data collection.
We also want to serve as a community resource for newcomers and current practitioners of open data reuse. Therefore, we view data reuse as enabling both derivative data analysis  and meta research, as well as providing a mechanism for research reproducibility. 

## How will your initiative function?
This initiative will work towards building a reproducible infrastructure for data reuse. We will work as a distributed group, and focus our efforts on the two components: education and knowledge advancement and data management. Any group member can work on any part of the initiative they choose, and we expect different subgroups to emerge working on various issues in the initiative. We will have regular group meetings via teleconference, which will be supplemented by discussions on the eLife Discourse. We encourage contributors to use [Trello](https://trello.com/) for managing issues and workflow, [Google Docs](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1yHUcHBlxWkk1QKkLRIwbeULo7oYbTJN1) for access to collaborative materials, and [Github](https://github.com/) for version control. Eventually, we will create an initiative website to centralize all of our resources.
 
## What are the expected outcomes of your initiative?

For the knowledge base with information on data reuse, our goals are three-fold:
 
* edit and update the existing course module on data reuse that is part of Reproducibility for Everybody [2] by introducing a greater degree of content and interactivity, and suitability for multiple audiences. Eventually, we would like to host a series of  webinars on topics in data reuse. 
 
* create new educational assets such as digital badges (microcredentials) and blogposts to foster educational opportunities on the topic.

* create a topical review [3] and curated reference list (annotated bibliography) [4] for existing research in the areas of open data, data reuse, and reproducibility.

For the data management component, we aim to develop common data templates (based on data structures) for sharing data and an architecture for recycling [4] data within and between disciplines. These will include establishing best practices for data sharing and reuse. These proposed standards will be an outcome of an online survey of community members, and will include an in-depth report on the survey results.

## Who will be involved?
Drs. Bradly Alicea (@bradly.alicea) and Marije Verhage (@m.l.verhage) have agreed to be the co-leads. The following Ambassadors have expressed interest in the initiative: @huajinw, and @bhavik.nathwani. Ambassadors need no previous experience in the topic, and all are welcome. A short onboarding session will be held for potential collaborators.
 
We also have a number of existing tutorials on How to Create Microcredentials and Version Control for Distributed Science to help people contribute to the project. The initiative website has more details.
 
## What is the timeline?
We are currently on an open timeline, although we do have several target dates for specific outcomes. Collaborators can suggest contributions using one of three methods: leave a comment for either project lead in Discourse, submit to the Google Drive by form or by upload, or make a Github pull request [in this repository](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Module-II-reusefulness-of-data).
 
## Current Milestones:
Blogpost draft will be submitted by November 2019 to be edited and finalized by December 2019. 

Information for course module update will be collected through September 2019. New sources will be discussed internally amongst the members of the initiatives through Dec 2019. Course module presentation will be updated through March 2019. Webinar will be scheduled for soon-after. 

Survey of community will be developed through Sep 2019. Survey will be live Oct 2019 through Dec 2019. Data will be analyzed, report collated through April 2020. Publication of the results follow thereafter.
