### Status: 
This initiative has been divided into three parts:

1) educational products such as microcredentials, short course materials, tutorials, infographics, and blog posts.

2) survey design to determine current and best practices.

3) bibliographic resources and community infrastructure (website, public lectures).

### Roadblocks:
There have been several roadblocks to success. One involves IRB approval for our survey. While we have been able to design an adequate instrument, we have not been able to acquire IRB approval for the survey design. We have also had a participation problem. While starting out strong, our core group does not have as much time to devote to the project as we would like. Furthermore, interest from the other Ambassadors is non-existent.  

### How can contributors from the next Ambassadors program contribute? 
We have regular meetings (ideally monthly) which are available after the meeting on YouTube. We also have a website, a Github repository, and host participatory events such as an instance of Open Access Week and Hacktoberfest. There are three channels for participation: making a Github pull request, filling out a submission form on Google Drive, and attending a group meeting.Please visit our “How to Contribute” page for more details: https://data-reuse.weebly.com/how-to-contribute.html

### Additional Notes: 
We also welcome contributors from outside of the Ambassadors program! This has involved expanding our mission a bit from what was proposed to the Ambassadors program. Fortunately, this has led to some exciting contributions in the areas of education and agent-based modeling.
